### **What is LexiAid?**

LexiAid, formerly known as AI Tutor or Rafa's Assistant, is an **intelligent and highly accessible learning platform** designed from the ground up to empower students facing severe learning challenges. It's a web-based application, meaning you can access it through any web browser, and it's envisioned as a **non-profit project**.

The inspiration for LexiAid came from the project lead's personal experience of wanting to help his son, Rafael, who has severe dyslexia, alexia (the inability to read words), and dysgraphia (the inability to write). The core mission is to adapt traditional learning materials and make them fully accessible, creating a supportive educational environment.

### **The Problem LexiAid Solves**

LexiAid was created to address the significant barriers that students with severe learning disabilities face in traditional education.

* **Inaccessible Materials:** Many intelligent and creative students are perfectly capable of learning but **cannot read or write effectively**, if at all. This makes standard textbooks, websites, and assignments major obstacles.  
* **Difficulty Expressing Knowledge:** Even when a student masters a subject, they often struggle to articulate their ideas. This can involve stuttering, speaking in short sentences, or repeating words, which makes it difficult to demonstrate their knowledge, especially in a formal test.  
* **Inadequate Support Systems:** Existing assistance programs are often expensive, hard to access, or simply don't provide the right tools. School accommodations, like providing a human scribe, can also be ineffective; in one instance, a student was assigned a scribe who didn't even speak English.

### **Key Features of LexiAid**

LexiAid is built on an **"auditory-first" philosophy**, recognizing that many of its users learn best by listening and speaking.

#### **1\. Making Any Document Accessible**

* **Upload Anything:** Students can upload any document—a PDF, a picture of a book page taken with a phone, or a web page print screen—and the app makes it accessible.  
* **Advanced Document Understanding:** LexiAid doesn't just pull out the text. Its **Document Understanding Agent (DUA)** analyzes the entire document, describing images and graphs in context and correcting punctuation. This ensures the audio version makes complete sense. For example, instead of just reading the words "STRONGER THAN DUCHENNE" over and over, it would first describe the image of people wearing t-shirts and then explain that this phrase is written on them.  
* **Visual Reading Tool:** As the app reads the text aloud with a high-quality, natural-sounding voice, it **highlights the words being spoken in real-time**. This synchronized highlighting creates a powerful multi-sensory learning experience.

#### **2\. Interactive AI Tutoring**

* **AI-Powered Comprehension:** Once a document is loaded, the student can interact with the AI Tutor. They can ask it to:  
  * Read the entire document aloud.  
  * Summarize key points.  
  * Explain complex concepts in simple terms.  
  * Answer specific questions about the content.  
* **Interactive Quizzes:** The AI can generate a quiz based on the document to help the student test their knowledge. The AI reads the questions aloud, and the student can answer by speaking.

#### **3\. AI-Assisted Answer Formulation (Not yet implemented)**

This is one of the most transformative future features of LexiAid. It will help students translate their knowledge into clear, well-structured written answers.

* **Dictate Your Thoughts:** A student can simply speak their answer or ideas, even if their speech is disorganized or "messy".  
* **AI Refines, You Control:** The AI takes the spoken words and refines them into a clear, written response. **Crucially, the AI is forbidden from adding any external information or knowledge**. It only works with the student's own ideas.  
* **Iterate with Your Voice:** The AI reads the written answer back to the student. The student can then give voice commands like, *"Change that word to..."* or *"Rephrase that sentence."* This back-and-forth process continues until the student is completely satisfied with the final text.

### **Who is LexiAid For?**

* **Primary Users:** The main user profile is a **student with severe learning disabilities** like dyslexia, dyscalculia, alexia, and dysgraphia. These are bright students whose main challenge is interacting with text-based information.  
* **Broader Potential:** While designed for this specific group, LexiAid's tools could also benefit a wider audience, including:  
  * Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), who have a higher-than-average incidence of dyslexia.  
  * Individuals recovering from a stroke or traumatic brain injury that affects their ability to read or write.

### **Who Should Support or Adopt LexiAid?**

Since LexiAid is planned as a non-profit project, its success will depend on support and adoption rather than sales. The key partners and stakeholders would be:

* **Educational Institutions:** Schools, colleges, and universities are ideal partners for testing and adopting the platform. Their disability and accessibility services departments would be the most interested parties.  
* **Sponsors and Foundations:** To grow and remain accessible, the project will seek support from sponsors and foundations interested in education, technology, and accessibility.  
* **Advocacy Groups:** Organizations focused on dyslexia, DMD, and other learning disabilities would be natural allies in promoting and improving the tool.
